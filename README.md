# Image Search Abstraction Layer

An api that allows you to search for images and review recent searches

### User Stories:
    1. I can get the image URLs, alt text and page urls for a set of images relating to a given search string.
    2. I can paginate through the responses by adding a ?offset=2 parameter to the URL.
    3. I can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings.
